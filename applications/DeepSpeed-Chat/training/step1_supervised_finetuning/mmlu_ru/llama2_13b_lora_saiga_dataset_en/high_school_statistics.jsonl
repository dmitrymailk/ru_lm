The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage. </s>\n<s> bot\n Answer: D </s>\n<s> user\n A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory.
