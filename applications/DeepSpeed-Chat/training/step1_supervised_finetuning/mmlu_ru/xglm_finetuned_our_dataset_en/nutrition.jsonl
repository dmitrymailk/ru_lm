The main reason this can happen is because:\n\nA. Foods containing large amounts of vitamin D are eaten by both poor and wealthy people according to various cultural reasons.\nB. The content of vitamin D in foods depends on the soil in which the food was grown so is not related to wealth or age.\nC. Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\nD. Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting. \nAssistant:\n\nAnswer:", "C", {"A": 0.1011962890625, "B": 0.400146484375, "C": 0.2244873046875, "D": 0.22802734375}]
