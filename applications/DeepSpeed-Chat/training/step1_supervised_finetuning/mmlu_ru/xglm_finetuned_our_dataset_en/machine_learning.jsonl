(Footnote: When regularisation parameter \u03bb is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.) \nAssistant:\nAnswer: C \nHuman:\nTo achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Hoeffding's inequality the IID test set must have how many examples?\nA. around 10 examples\nB. around 100 examples\nC. between 100 and 500 examples\nD. more than 1000 examples \nAssistant:\nAnswer: D \nHuman:\nTraditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\nA. It is too computationally expensive.\nB. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.\nC. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset.\nD. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set. \nAssistant:\nAnswer: C \nHuman:\nStatement 1| The derivative of the sigmoid $\\sigma(x)=(1+e^{-x})^{-1}$ with respect to $x$ is equal to $\\text{Var}(B)$ where $B\\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))$ is a Bernoulli random variable. Statement 2| Setting the bias parameters in each layer of neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True \nAssistant:\n\nAnswer:", "C", {"A": 0.11822509765625, "B": 0.326416015625, "C": 0.432373046875, "D": 0.10107421875}]
