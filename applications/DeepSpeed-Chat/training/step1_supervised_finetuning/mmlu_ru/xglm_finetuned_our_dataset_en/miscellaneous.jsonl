The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. Which of the following is the best way of describing the last three sentences of the passage (\"They became . . . in judgment\") ?\nA. The sentences emphasize the weariness the sitters feel after a long day's work.\nB. The sentences are used to paint a picture of the way in which the sitters wish they spent their evenings.\nC. The sentences are a vivid way of describing the ease and authority the sitters feel during the evening.\nD. The sentences highlight the contrast between the feelings of the sitters and the feelings of the bossman. \nAssistant:\n\nAnswer:", "C", {"A": 0.2083740234375, "B": 0.427490234375, "C": 0.228759765625, "D": 0.086181640625}]

I would work without a net and without the noise of the crowd to disturb me. The view from on high is dizzying, instructive. I do not record the world exactly as it comes to me but transform it by making it pass through a prism of fabulous stories I have collected on the way. I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?\nA.
