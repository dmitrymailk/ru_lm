When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\nC. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\nD.
